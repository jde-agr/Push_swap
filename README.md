## Compiling and Executing
To compile use the following command line
```
make all
```
There are two parts to this project:
* The **checker** which checks that the given commands will sort the list of numbers successfully or not

* The **push_swap** which will make use of sorting algorithmns in order to sort a list of numbers using a restricted amount of commands

>**NOTE** : We will make use of terminal typesets to store a list of **uniquely random numbers** generated by using ruby code as can be seen below
>
>```ARG=$(ruby -e "puts (0..n).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')");```
>
>Where the value for **n** will be replaced with the amount of random numbers you desire
>
>To view the values stored in **ARG** you can simpy use **echo** or **typeset** as shown below
>
>```echo $ARG``` or ```typeset ARG```

### **checker**
To execute the checker program use the following command line
```
./checker $ARG
```
### **push_swap**
To execute the push_swap program use the following command line
```
./push_swap $ARG
```
In order to count the number of instructions it takes to sort a randomly ordered list of unique numbers you can make use of the following command line
```
./push_swap $ARG | wc -l
```
You can combine the pipe the **push_swap** executable with the **checker** executable in order to ensure that the sorting algorithm works correctly by making use of the following command line
```
./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```

### **visualiser**
This applies only to the **push_swap** executable and can be enabled by passing through the **-v** flag as shown below
```
./push_swap -v $ARG
```
